title: Clarissa.exe Has Been Updated (Now with 98% More Nostalgia)
summary: In my day-to-day work as a developer, it’s easy to fall into patterns and lose the creative spark that makes coding exciting. I wanted to reboot myself and create something just for fun. So I redesigned my site in a Windows 98 aesthetic as a way to reconnect with my inner kid—the one who taught herself HTML on Notepad and thought computers were magic.

If you’ve landed on my site and thought, “Did I just time travel?” — you’re not wrong!
My portfolio now looks like something straight off the family computer I grew up using, complete with chunky buttons, pixelated icons, and all the nostalgic charm of Windows 98.

And while it might seem like just a fun aesthetic choice (and it is), this redesign is deeply personal too — a return to the version of myself who first fell in love with the internet.

The initial spark came from Hayley Williams’ website — a retro, windows-style interface that felt playful, unexpected, and weird in the best way. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

It reminded me that websites don’t all have to look like sleek SaaS landing pages or agency portfolios. They can be art. They can be experiences. They can be fun.

That reminder hit me harder than expected because, as a full-time developer, “fun” isn’t always part of the workflow.

<h2>The Developer Grind Is Real</h2>

Build. Launch. Repeat.

Working professionally, it’s easy to fall into cycles where every site starts to feel the same — similar layouts, similar patterns, similar revisions. I love what I do, but the industry tends to reward efficiency and predictability, not necessarily curiosity or experimentation.

After months (years?) of churning out performant, polished, client-ready sites, I realized I hadn’t built something just for the joy of building in a long time. Not for a scope. Not for a timeline. Not for a KPI.

Just because it sparked something in me.

And that’s when I knew I needed a project to bring that spark back.

<h2>Returning to My Inner Child: The Kid Who Taught Herself HTML</h2>

Before I ever called myself a developer, before I knew what WordPress was, before I understood what “frontend” meant, there was just me…
and the family computer.

I was the kid who spent hours exploring menus I probably shouldn’t have clicked. I loved the sound of windows booting up, the chunky UI, the weird pixel shadows. I loved customizing everything — cursors, themes, text colors — to make the computer feel like mine.

And one important summer, I discovered HTML.

It felt like magic.
I could type something, hit refresh, and watch the world on the screen change because of something I wrote.

I didn’t need permission.
I didn’t need a client.
I didn’t need to be good at it.
It was pure joy. Pure curiosity.

This redesign became my way of reconnecting with that girl — the one who was curious, playful, messy, excited, and stubborn enough to teach herself how the internet worked just because.

<h2>Why Windows 98?</h2>

Windows 98 is more than a nostalgic UI — it represents the beginning of an era of exploration for so many millennials. For me, it represents:

🖥️ Discovery
The first time I learned how computers think.

🎨 Customization
The joy of changing wallpapers, dragging icons, and making things feel personal.

💡 Creativity Without Rules
Before design systems, before style guides, before “best practices,” there was just “What happens if I try this?”

🤓 The Start of My Coding Story
My first HTML lines lived in Notepad. My first CSS experiments were… chaotic. But they were mine.

Bringing that visual style into my modern portfolio allowed me to bridge who I am today — a professional developer — with the kid who fell in love with making things on a screen.

<h2>A Portfolio That Feels Like Me Again</h2>

I didn’t want another minimalist portfolio with a hero section and a grid of projects.
I wanted a site that felt like Clarissa — nostalgic, playful, slightly chaotic, full of personality, but still rooted in strong technical execution.

So I rebuilt my portfolio with:
<ul>
	<li>Astro for a modern framework</li>
	<li>98.css for authentic Windows UI styling</li>
	<li>A custom WinBox-lite setup for draggable “windows”</li>
	<li>A faux terminal full of Easter eggs (because why not?)</li>
</ul>

The process reminded me why I love being a developer in the first place: I get to create worlds out of code.

<h2>Nostalgia as Creative Fuel</h2>

Sometimes as adults — as professionals — we forget the power of reconnecting with the younger versions of ourselves.
The ones who were curious.
The ones who didn’t care if something was “practical.”
The ones who built things simply because they were fun.

This redesign is my reminder to myself:
<ul>
    <li>✨ Creativity thrives when we make space for play.</li>
    <li>✨ Nostalgia can be a powerful compass.</li>
    <li>✨ The joy that brought us into tech is worth protecting.</li>
</ul>

I built this site for me first — to feel inspired again.
If it inspires you too, then that’s just the cherry on top.

<h2>If you’re a developer reading this…</h2>

Build that weird idea you’ve been thinking about.
Make something whimsical, nostalgic, unmarketable, unoptimized, or just purely joyful.
You deserve to make things that light you up — not just things that check boxes.

Our inner children deserve to code too. 💾💖
