  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of creativity and technology. My first taste of web development came from hand-coding MySpace layouts (yes, really), where I fell in love with customizing visual experiences through code.</p>
  <p>After nearly a decade in retail visual merchandising—honing my eye for layout, aesthetics, and storytelling—I transitioned into tech, where I now build polished, intuitive, and performance-minded websites for clients across industries.</p>

  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  <p>I believe a website should do more than “look good”—it should feel good to use. My work blends strong visual intuition with technical best practices: clean builds, fast loading, accessible interfaces, and thoughtful user flow.</p>
  <p>Whether it’s optimizing lighthouse scores, restructuring content for clarity, or designing components that elevate a brand, I’m driven by creating web experiences that are both beautiful and functional.</p>

  <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
  <p>Away from my editor, I’m usually tending to my houseplants, walking my dog, Hazel, or cuddled up with my cat, Bunny. I’m passionate about creating inclusive tech spaces and showing up as my full self in an industry that benefits from diverse perspectives.</p>

  <h2>Collaboration</h2>
  <p>If you’re looking for a developer who brings design sensibility, problem-solving, and genuine care to every project, let’s work together. I’d love to help build something that’s fast, accessible, and full of intention.</p>
