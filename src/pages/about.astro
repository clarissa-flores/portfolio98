  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>My journey with web development started with a love for aesthetics. I used to hand-code MySpace layouts for friends, and that passion for visual impact has always been a driving force. After a decade spent honing my visual magic in retail merchandising, I transitioned to the digital world, where I now use code to bring my clients' visions to life.</p>

  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  <p>I believe websites should be more than functional; they should be appealing, intuitive, and truly engage users. I approach each project with the mindset of crafting a curated online experience, where every detail, from design to user flow, is meticulously considered for maximum impact.</p>

  <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
  <p>When I'm not at my computer, you might find me tending to my houseplants, listening to a paranormal podcast, or curled up with my cat Bunny. On and off the screen, I'm driven by creating inclusive tech spaces and using my skills to make a positive impact. I believe technology should be accessible and impactful, and I strive to reflect that in every project I take on.</p>

  <h2>Collaboration</h2>
  <p>Are you looking for a developer who goes beyond just code? Someone who brings creativity, logic, and a social conscience to every project? Let's chat! Together, we can build websites that are not only beautiful and functional but also leave a positive impact on the world, one pixel at a time.</p>
